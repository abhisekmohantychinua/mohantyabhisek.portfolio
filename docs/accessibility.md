  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border: 0;
}
```

## Maintaining Accessibility

To maintain and improve accessibility in future development:

1. **Test with keyboard only**: Ensure all functionality is accessible without a mouse
2. **Test with screen readers**: Use NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to test screen reader compatibility
3. **Use automated tools**: Run Lighthouse, axe, or similar tools to catch common issues
4. **Follow WCAG guidelines**: Aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance at minimum
5. **Consider all users**: Design for users with various disabilities (visual, motor, cognitive, etc.)
6. **Document accessibility features**: Update this document when adding new components or features

## Future Improvements

Areas that could benefit from further accessibility improvements:

1. **Color contrast**: Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
2. **Responsive design**: Test accessibility at all screen sizes
3. **Form validation**: Add accessible error messages for any forms
4. **Animation control**: Add options to reduce motion for users with vestibular disorders
5. **Language attributes**: Add lang attributes for multilingual content
6. **Automated testing**: Implement automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
